Course Website Boilerplate
===================
## Premise

**Problem:** Websites for University classes are far to fragmented and disorganised, usually due to a lack of knowledge on the instructors part for designing a readable and usable website or a lack of time.

**Solution:** This project seeks to provide a boilerplate with “modules” that an instructor can easily add and subtract to personalise his/her website while still maintaining a beautiful simplicity and organisational paradigm. This is in additional to a slew of features that make it easy for an instructor with little knowledge or time to create a functional website.

## Modules

+ Announcements
+ Course Information
+ Instructor Information
+ Office Hours
+ Textbook
+ Assignments
+ Lectures (Integrated with Calendar?)

+ External Links

## Features

+ Simple
+ Uniform Color Scheme and Layout
+ Easy File Uploading 
+ File Name Parsing and Automatic Organisation
+ Google Calendar Integration (?)
+ GUI or Prepossessing Syntax for Easier Information Input
